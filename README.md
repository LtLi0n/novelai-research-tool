NovelAI Research Tool - `nrt`
=============================
A `golang` based client with:
* Minimum Viable Product implementation of a NovelAI service API client
  covering:
  - `/user/login` - to obtain authentication bearer tokens.
  - `/ai/generate` - to submit context and receive responses back from the AI
* Iterative testing based on JSON configuration files.  

Downloading
-----------
It is recommended that if you are a normal MacOS or Windows user that you download the latest release from https://github.com/wbrown/novelai-research-tool/releases.

* If you are a MacOS user on an Intel machine, you will want the `darwin-amd64`, otherwise if you are on an Apple Silicon machine, you will want `darwin-arm64`.
* The vast majority of Windows users will want the `windows-amd64` build.

I have left Linux builds as an exercise for the user, as it is generally very easy to build on Linux.

Building
--------
You will need the `golang` language tools on your machine.

* **Windows:** Download and install from here: https://golang.org/doc/install
* **Mac:** If do not use `brew`, you could download from
  https://golang.org/doc/install; otherwise `brew install go`
* **Linux:** Use your package maager to install `go` or `golang`. If you're
  using Linux, I presume you know how to do this.

Get a copy of the source code either by:
* Downloading the ZIP file: https://github.com/wbrown/novelai-research-tool/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
* Or `git clone https://github.com/wbrown/novelai-research-tool.git` -- if you
  want to keep up to date, it's strongly recommended that you install
  [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and use that.  If you do, you can just type
  `git pull` to get the latest source code updates.

Once you have the source code extracted, go into the the source directory, and do the following from the command line:
  * `go get -u`
  * `go build nrt-cli/nrt.go`

This will produce a binary `nrt` file.

Setup
-----
The `nrt` tool uses environment variables to hold your NovelAI username and
password.  They are:
  * `NAI_USERNAME`
  * `NAI_PASSWORD`

**Windows:**

On Windows, type the following in at the command prompt:
```
setx NAI_USERNAME username@email.com
setx NAI_PASSWORD password
```

You will need to restart the command shell to load these settings.

**MacOS/Linux:**
* On MacOS, edit the `.zshrc` file in your home directory..
* On Linux, eidt the `.profile` file in your home directory.

Add the following lines:
```
export NAI_USERNAME="username@email.com"
export NAI_PASSWORD="password"
```

Either re-login, or restart your terminal, or type the above two lines directly
into your shell prompt.

Running
-------
There is a test file in `tests/need_help.json` that you can run, by invoking:

* Windows: `nrt tests/need_help.json`
* MacOS/Linux:  `./nrt tests/need_help.json`

This will generate multiple output files in `tests` after about 30 minutes,
each containing 10 iterations of 10 generations each.

Scenario Support
----------------
You may optionally provide `nrt` with a `.scenario` file directly without writing
a test specification `.json` file. You just can't control things like permutations,
or setting variables.

* Windows: `nrt tests/a_laboratory_assistant.scenario`
* MacOS/Linux: `./nrt tests/a_laboratory_assistant.scenario`

It will produce a `.json` and `.txt` output file in the same directory as the
`.scenario` file.

Output Processing Tip
---------------------
You can use an utility called [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to massage
the output JSON into something that is readable. An example usage is:

`jq --raw-output ".[]|\"\n*********************************\nOUTPUT \(.settings.prefix)\n\(.result)\"" nrt_outputfile.json`

For example:
```
$ jq --raw-output ".[]|\"\n*********************************
  \nOUTPUT \(.settings.prefix)\n\(.result)\"" 
  white_samurai_output-6B-v3-style_hplovecraft-2021-07-10T153527-0400.json
*********************************
OUTPUT style_hplovecraft
There is silence for several seconds before anyone answers. Then I hear footsteps
approaching the door, and then the sound of sliding bolts being drawn back. In moments,
a young man opens the door, wearing only his yukata, or loose-fitting white robe. He has
black hair tied into a ponytail, and he appears nervous. "Can I help you?" he asks,
speaking English.
"Yes," I say, "I was wondering if you knew what kind of establishment this is."
...
```

You can also add things to the output, for the variables you are interested
in, such as `temperature` or `top_k`.

`jq --raw-output ".[]|\"\n*********************************\nOUTPUT \(.settings.prefix) TEMP: \(.settings.temperature) TOP_K: \(.settings.top_k)\n\(.result)\"" nrt_outputfile.json`

For example:
```
$ jq --raw-output ".[]|\"\n*********************************\nOUTPUT \(.settings.prefix)
  TEMP: \(.settings.temperature) TOP_K: \(.settings.top_k)\n\(.result)\""
  white_samurai_output-6B-v3-style_hplovecraft-2021-07-10T153527-0400.json
*********************************
OUTPUT style_epic_fantasy TEMP: 0.55 TOP_K: 100
The sound of footsteps approaches quickly from behind me, and then stops abruptly
 My eyes widen as I turn around slowly. Standing before me, holding his sword pointed
 toward me, is a man wearing black hakama pants and a white jacket over them. He has a
 mask covering his face, except for his mouth, nose and eye holes. His hands are empty,
 though he carries a small leather pouch containing something wrapped in cloth.
 ...
```

Details of `test.json`
----------------------
The `nrt` tool accepts a single filename as an argument, the `.json` file
containing test parameters. They are more or less self-explanatory, but I
will highlight some specific ones:
  * `scenario` - `nrt` supports `.scenario` files that you can download from
     NovelAI!
  * `prompt_filename` - where to get the prompts, this is a `txt` file for 
    easy editing of prompts without having to escape like you would in JSON.
  * `prompt` - the prompt if you'd rather put it in the JSON itself.
  * `memory` - NovelAI memory section, as text.
  * `authors_note` - NovelAI author's note section as text.  
  * `output_prefix` - where you want the JSON output from the generations to
    go.
  * `iterations` - how many times to run the test, effectively.
  * `generations` - how many times to take the output, concatenate, and re-feed
    back into the AI, like an user.
  * `parameters` - contains NovelAI configuration parameters according to the
    API's specifications.

The sample [need_help.json](tests/need_help.json) can be used as a template,
along with a [need_help.txt](tests/need_help.txt) prompt file. There is also
an example [need_help-6B_v3-vanilla.json](tests/need_help_output/need_help-Model=6B_v3,Prefix=vanilla,PromptFilename=need_help_txt,TS=2021-07-14T1659.json)
and [need_help-6B_v3-vanilla.txt](tests/need_help_output/need_help-Model=6B_v3,Prefix=vanilla,PromptFilename=need_help_txt,TS=2021-07-14T1659.txt)
file that contains an example of what output `nrt` produces.

Permutation Specs
-----------------
There is a special field of the `.json` file, `permutations`.  It is an array
of permutation specs, each permutation spec is a combinatorial set in and of
itself.

Most of the fields under `parameters` have a list counterpart under `permutations`.

You may find the current list of variables that may be permuted upon
(here)[https://github.com/wbrown/novelai-research-tool/blob/main/nrt.go#L29]

For example, a permutation spec that permutes on model `model` might look like:
```json
{ "permutations": { "model": [ "2.7B", "6B-v4" ] } }
```
This will cause the `nrt` tool to perform iterations across both models.

If we add other fields to permute on, such as `prefix` or `prompt_path`, it
becomes a combinatorial exercise -- the below `permutations` example will
generate `62` combinations and tests to perform:
```json
{ "permutations": [ {
    "prompt_path": [ "need_help.txt", "need_help_an_memory.txt" ],
    "model": [ "2.7B", "6B-v4" ],
    "prefix": [ "vanilla", "style_arthurconandoyle", "style_edgarallanpoe",
      "style_hplovecraft", "style_shridanlefanu", "style_julesverne",
      "theme_19thcenturyromance", "theme_actionarcheology",
      "theme_airships", "theme_ai", "theme_darkfantasy",
      "theme_dragons", "theme_egypt", "theme_generalfantasy",
      "theme_huntergatherer", "theme_magicacademy", "theme_libraries",
      "theme_mars", "theme_medieval", "theme_militaryscifi",
      "theme_naval", "theme_pirates", "theme_postapocalyptic",
      "theme_rats", "theme_romanceofthreekingdoms",
      "theme_superheroes", "inspiration_crabsnailandmonkey",
      "inspiration_mercantilewolfgirlromance", "inspiration_nervegear",
      "inspiration_thronewars", "inspiration_witchatlevelcap" ] } ] }
```

The above permutation set will test all the combinations of:
* prompts with and without author's note and memory.
* models `2.7B`, `6B-v4`
* all the current AI modules.

Another example is if we wanted to permute on the `temperature` value:
```json
{ "permutations": [ {
  "temperature": [ 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 ] } ] }
```

The above will cause 8 tests to be created, covering the `temperature` in `0.1`
steps from `0.1` to `0.8`.

Placeholder Support
-------------------
`nrt` supports NovelAI placeholders both as a way to populate `.scenario`
with default values, and as a way to permute on them.

The relevant key to use in both the specifications and the `permutations`
section is `placeholders`:

An example for the specifications settings -- any text in `prompt`, `memory`, or
`authors_note` will have placeholders evaluated and substituted:

```json
  "authors_note": "[Period: ${Period}]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]",
  "placeholders": {
    "Period": "In the Past"
  },
```

An example of permutation on placeholders; the below example will cause four different permutations to be created:

```json
  "authors_note": [
    "[Period: ${Period}]\n[Year: 2020 AD]\n[Style: Stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]",
    "[Period: ${Period}; Year: 2020 AD; Style: stream of consciousness, intelligent, funny]"
  ], 
  "placeholders": [
        {
          "Period": "Modern Day"
        },
        {
          "Period": "Present Times"
        }
  ]
```

Client
-----
A simple golang client for `nrt` that can be found in the `novelai-research-tools/client` folder.
After `nrt` is set up properly, click the `build.bat` file to build the client. This will automatically build the client.

The main purpose of this client is to test the API, namely the `logit_bias` functionality.

Logit biases work by increasing the weights of a token, which increases the chance it has to be generated by the AI. If the AI wasn't going to ever generate the token before, this will not make it generate it, unless the bias is incredibly high. This helps the AI keep on track, as the AI will be more likely to generate words that are related to how you want the story to go.

A bias of around -8.0 is as effective of banning the token, and around 1.0 to 3.0 makes it much more likely that it'll appear. 

You can find tokens with the tokenizer on the site, remember to include a space before the word, the majority of the time, the tokens are different. Words that are split up into multiple tokens are significantly more of a pain to deal with, but increasing the bias of the first part, then reducing it for every token afterwords helps.



The format for tokens is: 
```
  "authors_note": [[token id, bias as a float],[token,float],[token,float]],
```

The example provided in the folder was designed to create long, run-on sentences by reducing the likelyhood that punctuation tokens will appear.

The client has four options right now, which are used by typing the word IN FULL CAPITALS as your input.

```
RETRY - Retries the last input, giving you a new output.

SAVE - Saves the current story to prompt.txt.

BACK - Goes back to the last input/output, there is a maximum of 65536 entries, it may crash after this point.

EDIT - Edits the last output, this is very wonky and clunky, so be warned.

NEXT - Gives a list of potential next tokens that could appear. This list represents the liklihood of tokens appearing BEFORE logit_bias is applied.
```

Along with this, I've added a grab_logits.exe file, editing the logits.txt file will let you grab the json entry for logit bias much faster.
Enjoy!

Adventure Game
--------------
As a reward for reaching the very end of the document, there's a special treat.  An Adventure
module that replicates the classic _Zork_ experience.

To build it, go into the `adventure` subdirectory and type `go build adventure.go`.  This will
produce a binary `adventure` or `adventure.exe`.

Run it by invoking `./adventure` or `adventure.exe`, and you will be brought to a prompt:
```text
You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike. There are exits to the north, east, south, and west.
> 
```

Enjoy!
